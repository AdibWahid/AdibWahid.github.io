During my tenure as a Teaching assistant i covered two courses: Software Engineering and Software Developement Lab. Where I had to conduct lab sessions, discuss with students, teach them, prepare, and proctor exams. This is where I honed my skills on Django Framework as I frequently had to evaluate projects of students assigned under me. I helped them in understanding many fundamental concepts in Software Developement.
