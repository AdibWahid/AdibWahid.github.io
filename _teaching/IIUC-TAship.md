During my tenure as a Teaching Assistant, I covered two courses: Software Engineering and Software Development Lab. My responsibilities included conducting lab sessions, discussing theoretical topics with students, teaching them, and preparing and proctoring exams. This role allowed me to hone my skills in the Django Framework, as I frequently evaluated student projects. I helped students understand fundamental concepts in Software Engineering, such as Software Processes, Requirements, Requirement Engineering Processes, and Software Design.

Other topics covered throughout the semester included cognitive fundamentals, management implications, project staffing, software cost estimation techniques, different models (COCOMO, tree, PNR curve, statistical and Delphi), process quality assurance, software and documentation standards, software metrics and product quality metrics, software processes and software process models (linear sequential, waterfall, prototyping, incremental, spiral), advanced software development life cycles, and other appropriate models. Additionally, we addressed software reliability metrics, software reliability specification, statistical testing, and reliability growth modeling.

I also taught them about Verification and Validation planning, testing fundamentals (including test plan creation and test case generation), black-box and white-box testing techniques, unit, integration, validation, and system testing, as well as object-oriented testing and inspections. In the lab sessions, I did my best to teach them about popular frameworks and how to deploy them.
