Even though I started debating in high school, my main journey into the world of public speaking began in the second year of my undergraduate studies. I proudly served as the **President** of the **IIUC Debaters Community**, the central debating club of International Islamic University Chittagong, demonstrating a year-long commitment to fostering a thriving environment for intellectual discourse and public speaking. As a skilled debater, I represented my university on the international stage, including events such as the **Pre-Korea World University Debating Championship 2021** and the **IIT Delhi Parliamentary Debate 2021**. My team and I were **Runners-Up** at the **Kishwan-EDUDS National Debate Championship 2020**. Besides my achievements as part of a team in various national tournaments, I also received individual accolades in many competitions throughout my three years of service to my university.

I have been **Debater of the Tournament** Multiple Times. Most recent one being **PUDS Inter-Club Debate Tournament 2022** and **ICARUS Inter-Club Debate Tournament 2022.**

As an adjudicator, I have judged multiple national tournaments, showcasing my logical reasoning and sharing my knowledge to ensure fair judgments. Even now, whenever given the chance, I usually don't miss the opportunity to participate in such platforms.
